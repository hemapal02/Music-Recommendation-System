I'll create a web-based frontend for your music recommendation system. This will include a clean interface where users can search for songs and get recommendations based on your clustering algorithm.I've created a complete frontend for your music recommendation system! Here's what the application includes:

## Key Features:

1. **Search Interface**: 
   - Auto-complete suggestions as you type
   - Search by song name or artist
   - Clean, modern design with glassmorphism effects

2. **Recommendation System**:
   - Shows similar songs from the same cluster
   - Displays similarity scores
   - Shows song details (artist, year, cluster)
   - Animated cards with hover effects

3. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Interactive doughnut chart showing cluster distribution
   - Statistics display (total songs, clusters)
   - Visual representation of your clustering results

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Works on desktop and mobile
   - Modern gradient background
   - Smooth animations and transitions

## How to Connect to Your Python Backend:

To integrate this with your actual clustering code, you would need to:

1. **Create a Flask/FastAPI backend** that:
   - Loads your `cluster_df.csv` file
   - Implements the `recommend_songs` function as an API endpoint
   - Serves the song database for search suggestions

2. **Replace the sample data** in the JavaScript with actual API calls to your backend

3. **Example Flask integration**:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
import pandas as pd

app = Flask(__name__)
df = pd.read_csv('cluster_df.csv')

@app.route('/api/search')
def search_songs():
    query = request.args.get('q', '')
    results = df[df['name'].str.contains(query, case=False, na=False)]
    return jsonify(results[['name', 'artists', 'year']].to_dict('records'))

@app.route('/api/recommend')
def get_recommendations():
    song_name = request.args.get('song')
    recommendations = recommend_songs(song_name, df)
    return jsonify(recommendations.to_dict('records'))
```

The frontend is ready to use with sample data and demonstrates all the core functionality of your music recommendation system with a beautiful, modern interface!
